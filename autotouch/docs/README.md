# Autotouch docs index

This folder consolidates cross-project docs for the Autotouch repo. Subprojects (website, referral site, ads, outbound) also have their own README/docs. Use this index to find the right entry point quickly.

## Core docs
- `docs/attio/` — CRM (Attio) schema, API usage, and lead entry flows.
- `docs/ads/` — Google Ads + Search Console scripts and workflows.
- `docs/seo/` — Search Console review workflow + SERPER usage.
- `docs/website/` — Main website runbook and content/trackers.
- `docs/referral_site/` — Referral/comparison microsite overview.
- `docs/outbound/` — Outbound job search scripts and tracking references.
- `docs/linkedin/` — LinkedIn inbox workflows, RapidAPI enrichment, and reply drafts + approvals (with optional Attio steps).

## Where the actual code lives
- Ads scripts: `ads/`
- Referral site: `ads/referral_site/`
- Main website: `website/`
- Outbound scripts: `outbound/`
- SEO artifacts and weekly reports: `seo/`

If you add a new workflow, add a short doc here and link to the deeper project docs.
