# LLM Research Prompt: Autotouch Positioning + Conversion Messaging (Extremely Detailed)

## Role
You are a **website conversion specialist and positioning strategist** tasked with improving paid‑traffic conversion for Autotouch. You should think like a CRO lead who also understands outbound GTM tooling and how SMB teams buy.

## Goal
You are assisting a founder/operator in updating Autotouch’s website messaging to improve paid‑traffic conversion. We need a research‑backed positioning recommendation and concrete homepage copy direction. The work must explicitly address a real market context: many companies are reading about tools like Clay, Instantly, Smartlead, Outreach, etc., and they *don’t know where to start*. They have a mental model of “best‑in‑practice outbound,” but lack the time, resources, or desire to assemble and maintain a Frankenstein stack.

This update is urgent because current paid traffic is clicking but not converting at a strong rate, so we need a clearer message and a higher‑converting homepage experience now.

Deliver a response that:
1) proposes the most compelling positioning angles for Autotouch,
2) maps those angles to specific website hero/subheader directions,
3) explains *why* these choices should work for cold paid traffic,
4) provides a competitive framing vs Clay and Outreach (and optionally adjacent tools like Instantly/Smartlead),
5) includes a conversion-focused homepage structure.

## Required Inputs (Context)
Autotouch’s founder story (from a recent LinkedIn post) should shape the narrative:
- A “best‑in‑practice outbound program” stack typically looks like:
  - Clay for account research and personalization
  - Clay/FullEnrich for contact enrichment (phone/email waterfalls)
  - Outreach for sequencing
  - Nooks for dialing
  - Instantly/Smartlead for deliverability
- Many companies *like the idea* of assembling this stack, but:
  - They don’t have time or resources
  - They don’t want reps jumping between multiple tools
- Autotouch was built to combine the best of each into one workflow:
  - AI account research (Clay‑like)
  - Waterfall enrichment (FullEnrich‑like)
  - Sequencing + task management (Outreach‑like)
  - Dialing with local presence (Nooks‑like)
- Autotouch recently came out of stealth with several customers.

**Critical nuance you must include:**
Many SMB and mid‑market teams are *researching tools like Clay, Instantly, Smartlead, Outreach* but don’t know where to start. They need guidance, not more complexity. Our positioning must empathize with “information overload + stack anxiety.”

## Current paid‑ads performance context (why we’re doing this now)
Use this performance snapshot to ground your recommendations and urgency:
- Campaign type: Google Search, single campaign
- Time window: roughly Jan 7–20, 2026
- Impressions: ~2,266
- Clicks: 44
- CTR: ~1.94%
- Avg CPC: ~$7.92
- Spend: ~$348
- Google Ads conversions (primary action = `form_submit`): 1
- GA4 shows higher `form_submit` events than Ads/CRM, suggesting client‑side event inflation and/or weak conversion experience.

Interpretation:
- Targeting + messaging are not wildly off (CTR/CPC look normal), but conversion is low.
- The right move is to **improve the conversion layer** (homepage + CTA + clarity) while continuing to run the campaign for more signal.

## Research Requirements
Use current (January 2026) positioning from the market:
- Clay: data enrichment, AI research agents, workflow automation
- Outreach: enterprise sales engagement + AI agents + workflow orchestration
- Instantly/Smartlead: deliverability, inbox infra, cold email scale
You do not need to browse, but the response should reflect plausible current market language and signal-awareness. If you do browse, summarize rather than quote.

## Output Requirements (Structure)
Your response must be extremely detailed. Include:

### 1) Market framing and user psychology
- Describe how SMB teams *think* about outbound tooling today.
- Explain why they feel stuck (“I want the Clay + Outreach stack, but I can’t build it”).
- Explicitly mention that they read about these tools but don’t know where to start.
- Describe decision-making friction: too many tools, unclear ROI, no internal ops.

### 2) Competitive map
- Provide a short profile of each: Clay vs Outreach vs Instantly/Smartlead.
- Highlight their strengths but *also* why they are insufficient for SMBs who want end‑to‑end execution.
- Identify the “gap in the market” Autotouch fills: integrated research→enrichment→sequencing→calling in one system.

### 3) Positioning hypotheses (3–4 options)
For each option, provide:
- Positioning statement
- Who it’s for
- Why it’s credible (tie back to the integrated stack story)
- Why it converts cold traffic

Examples of positionings to explore (you can refine):
- “All‑in‑one outbound execution for SMB teams”
- “The outbound stack, already assembled”
- “Outreach‑grade sequencing without enterprise overhead”
- “Research → enrich → sequence → call in one workflow”

### 4) Homepage hero copy recommendations
For at least 3 options, provide:
- Headline
- Subheader
- Primary CTA
- Secondary CTA
- A one‑sentence “belief shift” explaining why this headline will resonate with paid traffic

### 5) Homepage structure (conversion‑first)
Propose a recommended structure and explain *why* each block exists:
- Hero (ICP clarity + outcome)
- Proof or trust strip
- “Stack replacement” section
- Short “how it works” section
- Low‑friction CTA / quick demo
- FAQ to handle objections

### 6) Specific objection handling
List likely objections and how to address them in copy:
- “Is this just another Clay?”
- “Do I have to replace Outreach?”
- “Will this hurt deliverability?”
- “Is this too complex for a small team?”

### 7) Short test plan
A minimal plan for how to validate new positioning:
- A/B test 2 hero variants
- Measure demo starts + form_submit conversion from paid traffic
- Recommend threshold sample size (e.g., 60–100 clicks)

## Tone & Style
- Extremely detailed and structured, like a high‑quality strategy memo.
- Clear and persuasive, but not hypey.
- Focus on conversion and clarity.

## Output Format
Return a structured document with headings and bullet points. Provide final text that could be copied into a working doc.
